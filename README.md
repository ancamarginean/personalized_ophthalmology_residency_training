Residency dataset was created by combining and curating three public dataset:
1) Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) [ODIR 5k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k)
2) Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset ([RFMID](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/retinal-fundus-multi-disease-image-dataset-rfmid)) 
3) the public part  (1000 CFPs) of the Joint Shantou International Eye Centre ([JSIEC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8355164/)) dataset.

The csv included in this respository includes images from all these three datasets. The method to combine them is described in the paper.
